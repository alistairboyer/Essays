    "Close your eyes and imagine a world where every dataset is nicely curated. \n",
    "There is a detailed data dictionary that explains the purpose of each column and all the values that could ever be contained within.\n",
    "Each column has an optimal type associated with the data that provides convenient methods to access the various properties of the data. \n",
    "There are no duplicates across rows. There are no ambiguity across values. \n",
    "Now, __wake up__ because we all know that this is not the world we live in.\n",
    "Working with data most often involves spending a disproportionate amount of time extracting and cleaning data from frustrating sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A clear contender for the worst offender in the category of swallowing valuable time is tabular data stored in PDF files.\n",
    "These portable files that are super convenient for presenting formatted information and dominate the document landscape.\n",
    "In 2015, [Adobe's Phil Ydens revealed](https://youtu.be/5Axw6OGPYHw) that >70 million new PDFs were saved every day in the Google Cloud; and simple maths extrapolates the total number of PDFs to be well over 2 trillion. \n",
    "However, all this portability comes at a heavy cost. The data within a PDF file is stored as an almost random selection of texts and shapes and their properties and coordinates within each page. \n",
    "We have all experienced the actuality of this when dragging across text within a PDF page to find various words and phrases selected in a random order including page number and headers.\n",
    "What makes extracting data from a PDF even more frustrating is the knowledge that this exact same data exists somewhere in a much more convenient form that someone has decided not to share. \n",

    "I have been reviewing AI Ethics policies and came across the 2019 [perspective article](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2) in _Nature Machine Intelligence_ by Anna Jobin, Marcello Ienca and Effy Vayena, titled \"The Global Landscape of AI Ethics Guidelines\" [__2019__, _Vol 1_, pp 389-399].\n",
    "The article covers principles and guidelines for ethical artificial intelligence published across the globe and includes a list of these policies as Table S2 within the [PDF Supplementary Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2#Sec17). \n",

    "This two-part article describes my elongated journey into this challenge and covers the state-of-the-art for PDF extraction in May 2024.\n",
    "[__Part 1__](RateLimiting_CompaniesHouse_Part1.ipynb) starts with a custom approach to table extraction using __pypdf__ to match all text within the rectangles that make up the table and building an automated response to getting the data.\n",
    "[__Part 2__](RateLimiting_CompaniesHouse_Part2.ipynb) looks at the python packages that are designed for tabular data extraction, starting with __Adobe__'s API for table extraction that reinforces their PDF experience with ML and AI techniques.\n",
    "Then looking at a smorgasbord of python packages: __pdfplumber__, __tabula__ and __camelot__."

    "A PDF file is a collection of text and graphics information and the information required to present this on a page, _i.e._ location, font, transformation, kerning, etc&hellip;.\n",
    "A significant challenge is that unlike something like HTML where the structure of the file reflects the structure of the document, in PDF there is __no guarantee__ that order of data is correlated with its location on a page. \n",

The secret credentials are protected by storing as environment variables that can be retrieved using the [`dotenv` package](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/). \n",

This is an `ExtractPDFOptions` object created using the `.builder()` method with the desired text element type: `ExtractElementType.TEXT` and `ExtractElementType.TABLES` added using the `.with_element_to_extract()` chained method, before being `.built()`.\n",

    "There are over 5 trillion PDF files in the world and they hold a wealth of valuable information locked within their pages. \n",
    "Extracting tables from PDF documents can be a challenging task due to the complexity and variability of the PDF file format.\n",
    "Having spend considerable effort in creating a custom table extractor using `pypdf` in [__Part 1__](RateLimiting_CompaniesHouse_Part1.ipynb) of this article, \n",
    "and here in [__Part 2__](RateLimiting_CompaniesHouse_Part2.ipynb) we considered the state-of-the-art in python packages that are designed to streamline tabular data extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Adobe__'s own API delivers table extraction and offers 500 requests per month at the free tier.\n",
    "There is the overhead of setting up the API and the requirement to transmit the PDF file to Adobe for processing but Adobe successfully delivered an excel file containing the table.\n",
    "__pdfplumber__ was the most straightforward package to use and delivered excellent results.\n",
    "__tabula__ had the complication of setting up a link between python and a Java backend. tabula delivered the data but this had the most errors and initially the data was spread across 250 additional rows before being combined.\n",
    "__camelot__ had the complication of installing ghostscript but delivered excellent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that rendering PDF documents as images followed by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a viable alternative for table extraction. There are many online tools to help this process and recent advances in computer vision make this a powerful approach that may even replace direct PDF extraction methods in certain scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the choice of tool for extracting tables from PDFs should be guided by the specific requirements of the task.\n",
    "The range of formatting in PDFs means that some customisation will be required for the best results in every solution. \n",
    "For example, here most DataFrames needed some cleaning.\n",
    "Overall, there are many excellent python packages to help extract your data from PDF files."
